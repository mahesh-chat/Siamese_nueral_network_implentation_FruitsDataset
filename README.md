# Siamese_nueral_network_implentation_FruitsDataset


Siamese neural network is implemented and tested using the Fruits dataset.
Dataset is downloaded from :-https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits

This Siamese Neural network is implementation of reserach paper :-http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~gkoch/files/msc-thesis.pdf




Acuurancy as a function of no of epochs is plotted below -

Final accurnacy achieved is more than 90 percent on validation set.It tells that model is trained well and able to perform good on other datasets also.
